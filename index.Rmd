# Introduction

Just a place to archive / backup my fermentation notes while as an added benefit learning a little bit about R, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), version control, and hosting a site on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- Resources:
  - [Getting started with Git and R](https://happygitwithr.com/)
  - [Bookdown tutorial](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)

*Note:* entries before May 2022 weren't kept well and may lack enough information to be reproducible.  Remedying this moving forward is a major goal of these notes.
