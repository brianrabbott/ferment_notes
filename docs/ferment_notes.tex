\textbf{Bulk Ferment}

\emph{Tuesday, July 6, 2021}

Brewed new batch as usual. Added one 16 oz bottle of water to fill the crock.

Plastic bottle was hard after a few days, put in fridge. Could have let it get harder, as bottles didn't have much carbonation, but gained some in fridge (we were gone July 11-16).

\emph{Sunday, July 18, 2021}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  12 day first ferment

Flavored with just peach. Opinion: ginger and peach is better.

\textbf{Second Ferment}

Left for a few months. Checked periodically to ensure nothing looked off.

\textbf{Second Ferment}

\emph{Sunday January 23, 2022}

Had reduced to \textless4 bottles during F1, trying f2 for science. One plastic bottle for carbonation gauge.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Flavor: pear and ginger

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    1 cc size cubes
  \item
    Sugar: 1/2 tsp in each bottle
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Unknown date}

Update: none carbonated, f2 for a couple of weeks at room temp. Tasted fine though, maybe a bit more tart than usual.

Again let sit for several months.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Quantity: 4 soda bottles filled to top of label
\item
  Flavor: about 12 strawberries and a sizable scoop full of sugar

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{contam}{%
\section{Contam?!}\label{contam}}

\textbf{Bulk Ferment}

\emph{Tuesday, May 17}

Standard method, no notes taken. Scoby was getting thick, so split some layers off of the top and bottom and kept the middle.

\textbf{Update}

\emph{June 2, 2022}

Checking in on it, looked like there was some mold growing on top layer of scoby. Scared me enough to compost it.

\hypertarget{batch-1}{%
\section{Batch 1}\label{batch-1}}

\textbf{Bug}

\emph{Early September 2021}

Started a ginger bug, chlorine evaporated water from starter sourdough jug. Arbitrary amount of grated ginger in small amount of initial water. After about a week added more ginger and a bit of sugar. Started shaking it, got bubbly.

\textbf{Bulk Ferment}

\emph{September 18 2021}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cut up a few chunks of skinned ginger and simmered in 2 qts of tap water for \textasciitilde15 minutes.
\item
  Strained out ginger solids
\item
  Added 2 cups sugar, stirred too dissolve
\item
  Added 2 qts of tap and let cool
\item
  Added strained ginger bug
\item
  F1 in cloth covered crock
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Second Ferment}

No notes, but it was pretty good. Definitely different than commercial versions.

\hypertarget{batch-2}{%
\section{Batch 2}\label{batch-2}}

\textbf{Bug}

\emph{May 24-ish, 2022}

Started bug with occasional feedings of arbitrary amounts. Grew vigorous after a few days, but ran out of ginger mid-covid quarantine so had to wait for a grocery pick up and bug grew stagnant. Revived with a couple (two) feedings, noticed a \emph{few} bubbles on May 31st. All feedings used de-chlorinated water left out overnight and ginger (skin included) grated on the fine side of a box grater.

\textbf{Bulk Ferment}

\emph{May 31, 2022}

Loosely followed \href{https://www.wildfermentation.com/the-art-of-fermentation/}{The Art of Fermentation} method.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Simmered 2 quarts of water with \textasciitilde5 in of coursely grated ginger (skin included, not sure if appropriate to have left it on) for about 15 minutes
\item
  Dissolved \sout{2 cups} 400 g sugar
\item
  Added 2 quarts cool water to dilute, tasted and let cool to room temp for several hours (very warm day)
\item
  Added bug (slightly less than \textasciitilde2 cups)
\item
  Mixed then strained through fine mesh sieve
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output}

Split perfectly between a half-gallon mason jar and a 2 liter kliner jar.
