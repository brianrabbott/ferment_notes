## Peach and Ginger

**Bulk Ferment**

*Tuesday, July 6, 2021*

Brewed new batch as usual.  Added one 16 oz bottle of water to fill the crock.

Plastic bottle was hard after a few days, put in fridge.  Could have let it get harder, as bottles didn't have much carbonation, but gained some in fridge (we were gone July 11-16).

**Second Ferment**

*Sunday, July 18, 2021*

- 12 day first ferment
- Peaches and ginger
- One plastic bottle as carbonation gauge

Left for a few months.  Checked periodically to ensure nothing looked off.  

**Second Ferment**

*Sunday January 23, 2022*

Had reduced to <4 bottles during F1, trying f2 for science. One plastic bottle for carbonation gauge.

- Flavor: pear and ginger
  - 1 cc size cubes
  - Sugar: 1/2 tsp in each bottle

*Unknown date*

Update: none carbonated, f2 for a couple of weeks at room temp.  Tasted fine though, maybe a bit more tart than usual.

## Strawberry

**Second Ferment**

*May 17, 2022*

Again let sit for several months.

- Quantity: 4 soda bottles filled to top of label
- Flavor: about 12 strawberries and a sizable scoop full of sugar
  - Macerated the strawberries in the sugar.  ~60 ml per bottle

*May 26, 2022*

All four soda bottles firm enough to not give, refrigerated

- Thoughts: a bit too sweet

## Contam?!

**Bulk Ferment**

*Tuesday, May 17*

Standard method, no notes taken.  Scoby was getting thick, so split some layers off of the top and bottom and kept the middle.

**Update**

*June 2, 2022*

Checking in on it, looked like there was some mold growing on top layer of scoby.  Scared me enough to compost it.
