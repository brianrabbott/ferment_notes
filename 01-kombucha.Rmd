## Peach and Ginger

**Bulk Ferment**

*Tuesday, July 6*

Brewed new batch as usual.  Added one 16 oz bottle of water to fill the crock.

Plastic bottle was hard after a few days, put in fridge.  Could have let it get harder, as bottles didn't have much carbonation, but gained some in fridge (we were gone July 11-16).

- Peaches and ginger
- One plastic bottle as carbonation gauge
